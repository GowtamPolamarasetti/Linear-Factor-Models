    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear factor models are the cornerstone of modern asset pricing. They posit that the returns of thousands of assets can be explained by their shared exposure to a small number of common risk factors. While many new factors have been proposed, this project focuses on the foundational mathematics that *any* such model must obey.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to use a simulation-based approach to verify three of the paper's most critical results:\n",
    "1. **The Impossibility Result**: A surprising structural constraint on models with tradable factors.\n",
    "2. **Sharpe Ratio Spanning**: The conditions under which factors can be mean-variance efficient.\n",
    "3. **Generative Models and GLS Factors**: A powerful link between abstract statistical models and practical, optimal portfolios.\n",
    "\n",
    "By verifying these propositions numerically, we aim to build a deeper, more intuitive understanding of how factor models work."

We demonstrated the necessary singularity of the residual covariance matrix, the precise conditions for mean-variance spanning, and the remarkable properties of GLS factors in linking generative models to optimal tradable portfolios.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Limitations**:\n",
    "It is crucial to recognize that this was a simulation-based project. The real world presents challenges not addressed here:\n",
    "1. **Estimation Error**: In practice, we do not know the true `Φ_t`, `µ_t`, or `Σ_t`. They must be estimated from noisy data, introducing significant error.\n",
    "2. **Model Misspecification**: The real data-generating process is likely far more complex than a simple linear factor model.\n",
    "3. **Time-Varying Parameters**: We assumed constant parameters, but in reality, factor loadings and covariances change over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite these limitations, this project provides a solid, intuitive foundation for understanding the fundamental mechanics of linear factor models, which is an essential prerequisite for tackling these more complex real-world challenges."
